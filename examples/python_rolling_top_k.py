"""Sliding top-K threshold round-trip — generate a synthetic price
series, derive a per-bar metric, compute the rolling K-th largest
value across the trailing window, and print a few entries to confirm
the helper does what the doc claims.

This is the CI-runnable companion to
[Rolling top-K thresholds](../how-to/rolling-thresholds.md). It runs
without flox_py's C extension because ``flox_py.rolling`` is pure
numpy — the import still goes through the package so the example
also smoke-tests that the module ships.

Usage:
    cd /path/to/flox
    PYTHONPATH=build/python python3 docs/examples/python_rolling_top_k.py
